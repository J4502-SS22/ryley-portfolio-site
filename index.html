    <h1>Maddy Ryley, Journalist</h1>

    <h2>Interested in B2B publications, pop culture writing, editing</h2>

    <p>I’m Maddy Ryley, and I am interested in magazine writing, editing
    and publishing. I have experience writing for both the <em>Missourian</em>
    and <em>Vox Magazine</em> during my years at the University of Missouri’s
    School of Journalism. In the fall of 2021, I was on <em>Vox</em>'s staff as an Eat+Drink editor. I also have been working at <em>Trade Show Executive</em>
    magazine since May 2020 as an editorial intern, working in the office during the summers and remotely during the school year.</p>
    <p>Following graduation in May of 2022, I will be joining the <em>Trade
      Show Executive</em> staff full time as its Associate Editor.</p>
