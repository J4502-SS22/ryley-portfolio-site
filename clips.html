<h1>My Previous Work</h1>
<h2>Writing</h2>

<p><em>Vox Magazine</em></p>
<p>I was able to do a ride along with Columbia's food truck Lilly's Cantina for Vox's Eat+Drink section.
  The focus of this story was to provide a sensory-detailed account of what it is like to work a rush in a food truck.</p>

<p><em>International Work</em></p>
<p><em>Indianblooms</em></p>
<p>In the spring of 2021, I had the opportunity to work with a team of writers from both the Missouri School of
  Journalism and Indian universities. We focused on the effects of COVID-19 on the hospitality industry, and I specifically reported and wrote about the
  airlines, airports and business travel in Missouri.</p>
