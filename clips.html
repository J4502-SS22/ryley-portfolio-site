<p>I was able to do a ride along with Columbia's food truck Lilly's Cantina for Vox's Eat+Drink section.
  The focus of this story was to provide a sensory-detailed account of what it is like to work a rush in a food truck.</p>

<h2>Editing</h2>
<p><em>Vox Magazine</em></p>
<p>While I was on Vox's staff I was an Eat+Drink editor. I was able to pitch, edit and help plan the photography for stories in this position.

<p>This fermentation guide went through a lot of stages. First, it was going to be a simple how-to piece, but it morphed into a story with a scientific angle by the end.
  I was able to create all of the jars in the photography for the story, too.</p>
