    <h1>Maddy Ryley, Journalist</h1>
    <h2>Interested in B2B publications, pop culture writing, editing</h2>
    <p>I’m Maddy Ryley, and I am interested in magazine writing, editing
    and publishing. I have experience writing for both the Missourian
    and Vox magazine during my years at the University of Missouri’s
    School of Journalism. I also have been working at Trade Show Executive
    magazine since May 2020.</p>
    <p>I am interested in doing freelance work that focuses more on pop
    culture and music, while I simultaneously work in the business-to-business
    publication sphere as my first job. You can check out my projects, resume
  and <a href="mailto:mmrxdt@mail.missouri.edu">send me a message</a>!</p>
